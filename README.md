# Random-Data-Analysis-and-Linear-Regression

Created a multi-tab Excel statistical project where I generated synthetic normally-distributed data, built random sample extraction logic, calculated descriptive and inferential statistics, analysed variable correlations and performed linear regression with visualisation. This transformed statistical theory into practical, measurable and interpretable results.
